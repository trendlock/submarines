The purpose of this paper is to investigate the suitability of the pump-jet selection for Australia's future fleet of submarines.  In particular, the question of the relative efficiency, and quietness of pump-jets in comparison to open propellers is of particular importance.  Much has been made of the significance of the pump-jet in the DCNS (now Naval Group) bid for the submarine, to the extent that it has been claimed that the pump-jet rendered propellers obsolete.
